## Overview: How to Play
Select the mode that you want to use. Study Mode will allow you to study verb conjugations. Quiz Mode is a game that will test your knowledge of the conjugations. This game will test your knowledge of IR, ER, and RE regular verb conjugations.

## Study Mode
This tool allows you to study and memorize verbal conjugations. When you start the game, you will see a French verb flashcard in the center of the screen. This verb may be conjugated or an infinitive. To see its translation, press flip. If you know the conjugation, press Remove from Deck. This will remove the flashcard from the deck of remaining verbs to learn. If you do not know the conjugation, press Return to Deck. This will return the flashcard to the deck so you can study it again. You can continue to view cards until you have learned all conjugations and infinitives.

## Quiz Mode
The French verb will be displayed on the center of the screen. You may see a conjugated verb or an infinitive. If you see a conjugated verb, type in the correct English conjugation. Include the personal pronoun (for example “we eat”) and press return. If you see a verb infinitive, type in the corresponding English infinitive (for example “to eat”) and press return. If you get the right answer, the card will be removed from the deck. If not, it will be returned to the deck. In the the upper left-hand corner, you can see the number of cards remaining in the deck in Number of Cards Left. In the upper right-hand corner, you can the number of wrong answers you have submitted labeled as Number of Wrong Answers.
